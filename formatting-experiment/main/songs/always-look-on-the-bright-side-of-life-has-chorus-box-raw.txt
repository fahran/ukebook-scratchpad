Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life – Monty Python
Some (Am)things in life are (D)bad
They can (G)really make you (Em)mad
(Am)Other things just (D)make you swear and (G)curse
When you've (Am)chewing on life's (D)gristle
Don't (G)grumble give a (Em)whistle
And (Am)this'll help things turn out for the (D7)best

[chorus]
And (G)always (Em)look on the
(Am)Bright (D7)side of (G)life (Em) (Am) (D7)
(G)Always (Em)look on the
(Am)Light (D7)side of (G)life (Em) (Am) (D7)

If (Am)life seems jolly (D)rotten
There's (G)something you've (Em)forgotten
And (Am)that's to laugh and (D)smile and dance and (G)sing
When you're (Am)feeling in the (D)dumps
(G)Don't be silly (Em)chumps
Just (Am)purse your lips and whistle - that's the (D7)thing

[chorus]

For (Am)life is quite ab(D)surd… and (G)death's the final (Em)word
You must (Am)always face the (D)curtain… with a (G)bow
For(Am)get about your (D)sin… give the (G)audience a (Em)grin
En(Am)joy it… it's your last chance any(D7)how

So (G)always (Em)look on the
(Am)Bright (D7)side of (G)death (Em) (Am) (D7)
(G)Just be(Em)fore you (Am)draw your
(D7)Terminal (G)breath (Em) (Am) (D7)

(Am)Life's a piece of (D)shit… (G) when you look at (Em) it
(Am)Life's a laugh and (D)death's a joke it's (G)true
You'll (Am)see it's all a (D)show
Keep 'em (G)laughing as you (Em)go
Just re(Am)member that the last laugh is on (D7)you
[chorus] x2 then (G)
